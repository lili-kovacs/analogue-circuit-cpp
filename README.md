# analogue-circuit-cpp
final project for PHYS30762 Object-Oriented Programming in C++
-----
The aim of this project was to create a program in C++ that allows the user to create an analogue
circuit by adding arbitrary components. The program is then able to calculate its impedance (with
magnitude and phase information) and display circuit and component information.
The source code includes an abstract base class for components and a circuit class, through
which the operations are performed.
